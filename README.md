# CanvasChallengeOne


Challenge1

This challenge has been addressed using Java technology. StartProg is the main class to initiate the range printing request. This design reads the input from the user starting number and ending number. Validation has been added to take care inititate request only if end number is greater than start number.

Here i'm using for loop to iterate through the list by incrementing 4 each loop so that the operation can be performed in minimum loop.
If a giver start number is odd then using modulus opeartor i'm incrementing by one before entering the loop.

I have written Junit test cases just for testing data set return value.


Steps to run: 
System would prompt to enter start number and end number, for non-number system would terminate with error message.
Enter start number less than End number to perform operation.
Result will be printed on the console by comma seperated.
